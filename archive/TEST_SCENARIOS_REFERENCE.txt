QUICK REFERENCE: What We're Testing and Why
"""

BASELINE (Current Model):
  - Recency weights: [2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
  - Features: 8 (BoxWinRate, AvgPositionLast3, WinRateLast3, GM_OT_ADJ_1-5)
  - Performance: 284 bets, 63.7% strike, +1.21% ROI on $1.50-$2.00

SCENARIO 1: AGGRESSIVE RECENCY
  - Weights: [3.0, 1.5, 0.8, 0.5, 0.3]
  - Theory: Most recent race is MUCH more predictive
  - Expected impact: +0.5-1% ROI if recent form matters more
  - Rationale: Model feature importance shows race 1 = race 5, so maybe current weighting is too flat

SCENARIO 2: MODERATE RECENCY
  - Weights: [2.0, 1.5, 1.2, 0.9, 0.7]
  - Theory: Gradual decay instead of plateau
  - Expected impact: +0.2-0.5% ROI if smooth decay is better
  - Rationale: Smoother penalty for older races

SCENARIO 3: BALANCED RECENCY
  - Weights: [2.5, 1.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
  - Theory: Split between aggressive and baseline
  - Expected impact: +0.3-0.8% ROI (middle ground)

SCENARIO 4: NEW FEATURES (Weight + Distance + Box + DaysSince)
  - Add 4 new features:
    * WeightClass: Heavy (33+kg) dogs win 15.2%, Light (<30kg) 13.0% → 2.2% edge!
    * DistanceNorm: Normalized distance (some distances have higher win rates)
    * BoxDraw: Box 1 wins 19%, Box 5-8 win 12-13% → 6-7% edge!
    * DaysSinceLastRace: Fitness indicator (if rest time matters)
  - Expected impact: +1-2% ROI (highest potential!)
  - Rationale: Data shows clear correlations with win rate

KEY QUESTION THESE ANSWER:
  1. Is recent form REALLY more important than older form?
  2. Can we extract additional edge from weight and box position?
  3. What's the best way to weight race history?
  4. How much can we improve beyond +1.21% baseline?

TARGET:
  - Reach +2.5% to +3.5% ROI on $1.50-$2.00 range
  - This would make it highly profitable (~1 bet per day, $30-50/day at $10 stakes)
  - Would address the original problem completely (went from -83% to +2-3% ROI)

TIMELINE:
  Script running now testing all 5 scenarios in parallel
  Should complete in 20-30 minutes
  Will show detailed metrics for each scenario
